        "Construct a Convolutional Neural Network that extracts depth from images using a bio-inspired approach."
    ],
    "how": [
        "Utilisting Keras and Python, the CNN was designed based on literature of human depth perception mechanisms and cells in the visual cortex.",
        "Network was trained on correlated and anti-correlated Random Dot Sterograms variations to validate the model's performance against human results."
    ],
    "result": [
        "The model was successfully able to extract depth from images, mimicing results seen from human trails found in literature."
