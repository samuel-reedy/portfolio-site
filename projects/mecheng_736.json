    "what": "Built and integrated an underwater camera system to monitor and track the position of the insaive seaweed species Caulerpa.",
    "how": "The camera system was built using a Raspberry Pi and a camera module. The camera was mounted on a custom 3D printed mount that was attached to the ROV. The camera was then connected to the Raspberry Pi and the video feed was streamed to a laptop on the surface.",
    "result": "The camera system was able to successfully track the position of the Caulerpa and provide real-time data to the research team. This data was then used to develop a plan to remove the invasive species from the Gulf.",
